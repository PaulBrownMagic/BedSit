# TicTacToe example

This one's to show using either
[SitCalc](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/SitCalc) or
[STRIPState](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/STRIPState) as the
back-end. This is a port of
[TicTacToeTalk](https://github.com/PaulBrownMagic/TicTacToeTalk), we've
not updated how the GUI works.
